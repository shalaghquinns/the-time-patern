1,"Dense collective karma meets person to alchemize what has been frozen over. When we can learn to forgive no mater what the subtle body opens the door for selfs to be able to carry to load, and make it lighter for those around. Unconditional love for each moment should be fostered. ","Existence is poised on the verge of infinity, meeting life with an openness to receive it all equally. Subtle variations on experiences cleanse the doors of perceptions regularly, and we meet the moment with an immediacy and in full participation. Consciously aware of the bodies limitations to keep up with the vastness of our experience, we can be overcome by the wonders that never lived, feeling the immeasurably limitless perspective as a faint echo. The embodiment of a living dream.","Charged with a self awareness that beats us knowingly. Our individual uniqueness sees itself clearly and untangled. Each moment is met without pre existing limitations to open perspectives and bring forth a vision whats beyond possible. If inverted towards self worship, we hold a specialized immunity that seeks to impose its status and excerpt personal authority. Our power lies in using our individual focus to bless and redeem the whole.","Coming into each sequence of life in full embodiment of our own pace. A willing engagement and full participation to move into what is next. Haunted subtly by the ghosts of the past and ingrained patterns, which motivate is sharply and sometimes ruthlessly to take up each new venture in the discovery of fresh territory. Karmically overcoming old memories to form an entirely new path of creating self into being.","Receiving the world through the senses, and as it meets him he feels as if it were designed and meant for him. This quality of awareness is unique and always open enough to digest many worlds of streams, yet the pull to move inwards is dim. If he has recognized an internal gift and pull, then this placement leaves the space to open, grow and receive the senses needed to participate in the vision. Without internal recognition the world will appear chaotic and lack foundation. Senses move inward to learn to grow from the inside out. "," He is himself and is committed to what immediately feels right. Emphasis on his own self assertion, and sphere of interest tends to negate the perspectives of others, giving them much less emphasis than he does himself. He is learning patience, tolerance, and integration of  others, which opens infinite doors by holding the same space for assertion and expression he allows himself. As he makes room for the other, it often contradicts his own assertion and he comes to own a full bodied response that creates an interaction that is lively, engaging and truly genuine. ","She can sense her senses are fertile, and she knows herself through an awareness that is subtly tuned to appreciate what is at the forefront of her existence. Her touch is intentional and simple, meant to draw out the depths of what is needed without force, and with gracious timing and rhythm. She has a clear view towards discovering what is deeply needed. Coming forth from the depths and to be fed from an internal stream that is stronger than the surface self. The imposter will come in and thwart the plan, but this stream knows deeply. ","Opening the unknown doors. Free direct and open communication with the moment. A direct touch to discover the moment, however is hindered by others need to move from a deeper substance. Must learn to open to the unknown and not to fear. Learning how to meet the moment without preconditioned ideas or instincts in order to open doors which once seemed to go against him.","Earth  We are stuck in karmic relationship patterns, and draw towards us those who continue to reinforce this lower octave. We are stuck in stories and assumptions, and therefore eventually prefer to be on our own. 
Sun: We are lit up with the permission to be fully and truly genuinely ourself, and we see the other as an individual, each with its own unique path for becoming. We walk onward to freeing our energy, noticing each individual is itself with its own destiny. We come to recognize that no one can hold us back in the same patterns of relationships we were once trapped in. Expressing the self. ","a vessel to pass and purge the moment. The moment takes her in breath by breath she is touched by the senses. They impact her, she flows with the current, but the pulses are brief, she doesn't dwell and moves with the emotion current as the  body meets the earth. "
2,We must constantly learn to open up to new possibilities against our built up rational will be tested and asked that we approach without preexsisting bias. Where we are asked to see through the veil at every juncture. ,"Seeing who we are on earth and being highly reflective of the teaching we receive. Trying on different masks from similar patterns and themes to deepen our understanding of the impressions we leave. Neutralizing the impact, recognizing the pattern, and then responding through present instinct, rather than pre determined performance, shows us our internal capability. All hesitation of the moments clarity can stop us from fully executing. This is teaching us to endure a thick consistency of contradicting forces and remain on our objective task."," We see ourself in pragmatic form and a working energy, and seek to embody this process. Learning to integrate living consciousness into physical reality. Viewing the self as a utility with many pieces and fragments that lack foundation or unified truth. Events which contain the seeds of a deeper purpose bring a greater participation with the unknown. Eventually the world turns into having extraordinarily richly dimensions, seeing from 2d to 3d. ","Knowing ourself and sure of what we must do. Finding the way to integrate the work we came to do by opening to spontaneity. Karmically coming from a place with developed gifts and abilities, but had lacked the framework to implement them on earth. Uncovering this task through remaining open to all side without preference and practising flexibility. Clearing mental irritability and internal projections to fully embody our journey, free of the way it should be, and into presence.","Two worlds working in tandem. The right integrates and rationalizes, while the left probes and stays open. Often the right is more dominant, but there is always a voice seeking to understand the hidden motive, and the brewing processes under the surface. Both voices cannot be integrated into each scenario, but must be built up and opened on their own terms for their contributing values. The right wants to see growth and steady structure, the left is learning to be open to worlds yet to be. Learning to find presence in 2 worlds of the body.","He is learning what he stands for and must uncover the truth in all of it by always activating multiple levels of awareness. Fine tuning this primal drive means stepping over the line, and back again time and again. Pushing yourself to either defend our position, or backing off completely. We learn to respect our primal drive by grasping a deeper understanding of the process unfolding over time, revealing many layers. Learning from our mistakes, and seeing life itself as valid, rather than one that needs resolve. ","She moves through the world with unease as she is pulled in many directions, each one calling forward all of her. The heart and head are at odds, and she is learning to integrate yearnings into reality. One side wants to simplify and strip it all down to necessities, and another side is pulled to reveal contradicting information. The goal is to be all herself to be bare and clear and purely present to reveal the path right before her eyes","He carefully carves conversation and mental structures, categorizing experiences to build a stable impression of reality. He becomes suspicious of new information that threatens his mental categorization, preferring a cozy but secluded home of personal assumptions. He is learning to meet the moment without taking his preconceived ideas for granted, realizing that rigid mental structures can isolate him.","Earth: We spread our energy out externally, entering into the world with a full thrust. We have forgotten who we are, we seek to move out even further to avoid this reckoning, living on the surface, frantically trying to keep going.
Sun: We are fashioning the self into being through small steps that lead to deeper embodiment of selfhood. A slow transition from escapism, into the fabric of everyday reality as a shared playground. Special sensibility towards the tactile and the now, to stick with ourselves, in gentle attunement to the weaving of destiny with the unfolding of the day. Becoming one with the self and earth. ","She is the vessel for the solution of the moment, the instructions for the constructive steps forward. But how often this energy this energy is tempted and tired, her discern for whats needed to fulfill her path becomes wiser. "
3,Fresh perspectives brought a new lifestream as we are faced with the stagnancy of pattern from all angels. Expression has engulfed the self and we must meet them with spontaneousness that is open to growth rather that another reason why it cant be done. Releasing ties. ,"Becoming at one with any world we meet in a flexible, adaptable manor. We venture at our own will into the maze of opportunities, pursuing a consciousness that delights in making connections and doing justice to all sides. This ability crafts a whole new frequency that can bend in all breezes and placed in the middle of anything to enjoy the outcome. We must become totally unaware of our identity to enter into a world where nothing is alien. 
","We participate in what's familiar and comforts us, to keep ourself hiding from having to move from an inward stance. Under our surface awareness there are vibrant passages coming alive and continually being revisited to reveal new information. We're meant to follow this uncovering them to be met with new inner world around each corner. If we hold onto knowness we become characterized and reinforcing of a surface identity and ideal image. ","Encountering something similar in every direction, and coming up against all the patterns and temptations that we've fallen for. From all the fragments births a regenerative power that can hold steady under the sway of the drama, impulses and reactions. Karmically having reinforced regressive patterns, our now initial desire goes against what we know we needs. A continuous journey to see beyond the engrained assumptions into a vibrant discovery of the unseen .","Internal awareness is open to its own unfolding process and the discovery of multiple streams of insights. Helplessly flooded by stimuli, and learning not to identify with set forms as it rides the waves of revelations by closely listening to the internal experience at each junction. Feeling drawn between experiencing chaos and controlling a restricted path. We must fashion our being from all the experiences and seemingly wrong turns, to recognize our durability and surrender to our adaptability so we can continue seeking and know we are still truly ourself. The realization is that no truth is greater than the other, and all moments are equally as revealing."," Sharply seeing and participating with the moment, he is instantaneously alive to make the most for everyone. If this initial spark should fly he is off, if not he waits and dwells, seeing it as a time in between time, waiting for the next spark. He is learning to take that time and find what is available in the unseen. Once he can see between the lines he can move candidly with his world without preference, discovering stimulus and value in the journeys without surface appeal. Learning that life cannot be planned or designed towards gratifying moments. ","She is open to receiving all of it, and is engaged as a force of self. Open to it all, but the ability to integrate and assimilate is tough as the pull outwards is stronger than inwards. The inward world is seeking a deeper link underneath all the senses. She is lighting up a this place  over time that contains the fuel to move inwards.","He is stimulated by the aliveness of the moment and the vastness of human expression, acting as a voice of magic. He tends to chase this magic manically, getting caught up in surface appearances and trying to force out an expression that cannot be consumed. By learning adaptability and dropping the mask of surface appearance, he allows the true magic of the scenario to reveal itself naturally.","Earth: Far removed from self, we live in separation from time, in a space of possibilities and delusions, a safe space where we do not need to confront the challenges of life. We cannot forgive our energy for staying here, and look down on our self for becoming paralyzed.
Sun: All streams are lit and we are delighted to participate in what we had previously missed. We are coming out of being thawed and are free in our body - delighting in the simple matters of life. Spontaneously flowing into each moment we unite others in this regenerative presence with our contagiousness revealing of surprise. Expanding the self.","The goal is to keep up with the continuous demands of the moment. To move with the ties, without drowning in attachment, to keep up with this placement requires presence and to tune into radical spontaneity that responds that responds to fullfil this constant stream of demands. It must be able to present to itself internally or else its energy is swept away and left empty inside. "
4,Deeply pulled underneath to give life to regenerative power. Turning thoughts of engrained entrapment into fertile soil. Moving with a step by step steadiness to address sharply limited perspective light and with patience. Not all suffer lasts forever,"Taking on the densest of gravity and learning to be a permeable vessel. To become permeable the consciousness removes itself and forms a perspective that exists as if it was not attached to the events at hand. The subconscious state remains at mercy, while the consciousness imagines what life would be if it wasn't under such influence. Can slide into delusion - or we can empower our conscious side so the the subconscious becomes a guide that moves through the earth's profound meaning and depths, providing orientation through darkness that is too hard to fathom with the mind.","Sensing the vast open net of consciousness and deeply aware of many terrible motivating factors. We side with the fears and shy away from seeing too much, while subconsciously finding our deepest courage. It is a great responsibility to see these depth, so we form a protective bubble of security, however Dark forces penetrate from below, to wake us up and tear away our foundation. Learning to trust as we become open vessels that sense the truth and infinite wonders available to fully fathom this reality.","Standing in the midst of a dense chronic condition, petrified, and designed to endure the search for core truth among delusion. Building strength to see through a fragmented world and find total inner resolve. Taking the long road, and drawing towards fears to redeem a karma of self suffering. Resiliency created by continuously digging deeper through doubt and denial to eventually carve the space to fully embody our truth fully and unite with the core of the earth.","Trapped in a deep hole of mental conspiracy that has no direction out. Our vessel is open to swallow the deep truths and lets the shadow consume us. There is no making logical sense of this condition, and we become deeply entrapped by our own memory. The way out is under, to recognize and take seriously the ways the world has outwitted and taken us over to activate beneath our assumptions so a power within can rise that no rational reasoning can hold us down any longer. Awakening to all the depths underneath comprehension, ","He is taking on and through him all the doubts, fears that anguish the edges of existence. His drive is to fix the problem, and in doing so takes on the weight and responsibility of it all. His goal is to undercut the initial voices, take instinctual responsibility, and see that the problem can be released and he is not its vessel. This placement can be trusted that it is the final stage towards moving through this pain, and when it can, will be fully taken care of by spirit forces. ","She stays rooted inwards close to what she knows, well venturing outwards seeking worlds unknown. The world around is less alive so she seeks the unseen to fill a void.  The search is far and deep, and she feels closer to self the further she goes away. Momentarily there is a completion, but the energy fades. She is living far, but eventually the outer worlds will reveal that same void. This is a path of learning to let go and uprooting patterns to open a fresh perspective. ","He is equipped to consciously handle and fathom the darkness, navigating the deep generational patterns that surface in his life. He often believes negative forces simply ""happen"" to him, failing to see that he is drawing in dense memories and ancestral patterns. Through small conscious steps and positive self-talk, he learns to uphold his own roots and meet the moment without painful preconceived notions.","Earth: We come from a world of high achievement and intend to keep it there and  remain immune to the sufferings of earth. Systems of hierarchy and structure have worked in our favor and we believe in our own advancement.
Sun: We are relieved and able to rest into the basic beautiful rhythm of life. Deeply in touch with ancestral forces which give us meaning and guidance we take up the limited course of action, to focus and become slowly drawn deeper into the world. Syncing with the time, and towards being completely present in the depths and density of matter. We meet heights through suffering. Drawn into the depths of self. ","The self is taken to deal with the full gravity of the situation, it must alchemize it from under the surface. If it shrugs off the responsibility it is left shining bright surrounded by its shadow, completely immobilized by denial. It must learn to fully accept its quirks in order to truly transform this current into an energy that gives action to being. 
"
5,"Profound staying power to gather forces and unite. Choosing one or 2 streams to gather and riley individuals into that area. Hyper individuality tends to dramatize heroic stance, and we must larn to welcome guidance. ","We see ourself as creation, and the world as our playground for coming to selfhood. Having learnt dance with our own darkness we can alchemize the ordinary through the inner lens to reveal to others the appeal of inner world. Creation and the self circulating and deepening in a boundless process. Having little separation from the self and what is streaming through means the self can be a loving influence for all to just witness the presence. ","Cultivating a space to move from the personality standards and image of false selfhood. Sensing the difference between the perceived exterior and what is true and alive. Drawn to recreate ourself from inside to reveal our creative power, for we are up against a temptation to play into socially acceptable roles. Entering the journey of shedding the external results to find our internal power. Keying into the intuitive arts and finding space for truth too manifest vision.","Coming into the world through our self, and unable to play into any surface appearances and egoic fantasys. We must move form origin, as we promised ourself to be sure to undertake the deepest path of selfhood unfolding. A karma with tremendous lessons in self discovery is here to take the journey in full. The backside is coming to terms with others less formed identities, as our own truth can never radiate fully if it is rooted in self righteousness. We must forgive and surrender our lesser self to come into communion with the regenerative powers of our species.","Each step is propelled by personal truth the embodiment of our mission. We can help others do the same, but are primarily fiercely concentrated on remaining on the mark of our own personal beliefs because of a deep awareness that the world attempts to strip us from this. Finding the fire of individuality which has a flame so powerful, and strong that any other way of knowing will not meet its standards. That knowing of self which is so on fire inside that it can not truly be impressed upon by the exterior world. Building up internal way of knowing. Getting rid of rational ","He is recognizing he is becoming who he was meant to be and the dance of purpose leads a light in a world where the primal self sleeps. He doesnt fit the mold, and moves forward without looking back towards his own individual deeply rooted creative expression, and tuning it in a way to make it readily available without inhibition. ","She works ahead of her world, and has all the gifts overflowing to present what is living inside. The job is to master timing as her vision has not yet been seen. She has created a room inside herself where she can be free and harness what lives inside, to the outer world it appears as is she has found a bubble or performance. She has given herself the right to express, and show others what can be done through this freedom. When she as at peace with herself she is at peace with her world.","His perspective acts as a flame for the self that burns past karma, inspiring others by identifying and clearing places of stuckness. He is so set in his mind that he tends to egoically dominate his world, believing he must always take hold of the moment. He is learning to integrate his world by understanding that not every moment requires his control or dominant perspective.","Earth: Lost in the collective pattern, one with everyone, joining forces. The reality seems to just happen to the individual, who remains anonymous, with subdivided selfs, merging with the identity with no conscious need to change it. 
Sun: A inward path is set a blaze to mobilize a destiny and carve a pathway for selfhood which no one can deny is not yours. Filled to the brim with loving awareness. The once slur of collective unconscious has now surfaced towards a loving force that seeks for selfhood on earth. This placement can be taken quite far in the creation of self. ","She is on her own path of becoming, initiated by a strong stream of inward power from her ancestors. This energy takes little influence from its outer world, and its will to be is tireless. Because its motive is so driven internally it is not turned to life's subtle graces and can miss much of the beauty that is not tired to one's own personal progression. Anonymous selfhood is its destiny, but it may be caught in the personality performance, learns that self embodiment is for its own terms, and cannot be fulfilled for the justification of others. "
6," Great finger points the way to the fullfillment of the assignment . We must fine tune the skills and intelligence. There is no explaining it, you are the personal for the job We are so subconsciously moved by this job that we do not attach egoicly with the work or story, just simply doing the work. ","The self is given a task and impersonally takes it up, finding the collective need meets her at every corner giving her little break. A part of us begins to question why we are doing all of this, and where do we fit into this world. This can bring resentment towards the task given at hand. To realize the impact of the work we are is doing we must remove the personal self from the matter. ",We are consumed by the awareness of a mentally fixated society and are working underneath to alter and form this programming. In the process we select and narrow down our perspective until it becomes a self reinforcing loop of ideas that keep us trapped in a pragmatic view point where our special track weighs heavy. When we can distill our perspective from being a me to a we then the most to essential values are revealed and our special inner knowing can work to regenerate the whole.,"On track and forming ourself around this track. Particularly in tune with the requirements needed to carve a path forward. What is absent is personal expression, which is supplanted with the functional skills of what we came here to do. Under the surface is a karmic promise to serve which contain hidden forces and move us towards direct and straightforward impulses that channel what is vitally needed. By giving energy to the bigger picture, the soul is given space to rest and recuperate, each day fashioning ourself further into a form living light. ","Devoting one self to the needs of the group, believing there is no greater purpose than functioning and forming oneself to meet the needs of what is required. Such enthusiasm to embody this perfected way of functioning; but is always subtly haunted by the inner knowing that this focus is denying him from experiencing much of his world. Scenarios will pop up as hints and keys that point to a part of ourselves we forgot to integrate. When the inner knowing learns to take responsibility for its own feeling it can meet the needs of the earth . Integrating knowing will with early forces.","He is a stream of specialized abilities requiring an outlet from feeling physically trapped. He is so aware of the shortcomings of the scenario and seeks to bring his gifts forward to heal this scenario. This will take some time for the inner and outer worlds to merge, but when they do, this energy finds a path where it can be comfortable and function beautifully. ","She is here to show the other what can be done, and has a unique gift inside that when given away she finds balance inside. Love meets the earth and must be carefully planned and executed. She is pulled to fill many roles and feels diluted if she fills them, so while she finds comfort in disturbing these roles, creating her own path, others find disturbing and therefore her gift takes on many trials before she learns to leave the gates open. Present awareness means channeling her gift towards the missing pieces in the shared pattern. ","He possesses a devoted consciousness aimed at serving and transforming the awareness of others through a focused path. Beneath his focus lies a bubbling neglect for anything that doesn't fit his path, revealing deep subconscious programming and rigid conditioning. He must clear his preconceived beliefs and learn to grasp the world beyond the binds of definition and the desire to have it all figured out.","
Earth: We have been stuck forever in a cycle of being everywhere and nowhere, never really getting down to the self expression as being haunted by the fact that you can't get down to it, or make any progress forward due to patterns of limitation. 
Sun: We see the source for a viable path forward - bouncing between memory and intention and gently craving out a path to be a ready participant in the shared reality. The self takes a line of work to keep these efforts in place. We are moving from the collective bounds into a consistent dedication towards a being with a one pointed endeavor of doing it right and being the to intellectual harness towards what's always needed in the objective scenario.

7," We are attcheched to the karmic story of our relationship, and tend to encounter the same broken storty. Here we breakthrough our deepest memory of connections and asks us to break to meet us here freely, and right now, we play out both sides of the equation until we can move freely from a place of vulnerability. ","The fabric of everything we experience is mirrored back relationships. These pulls, keys and karmic matches, are how we validate what is real inside and will always deepen us into the next layer.

Learning not to avoid ourself with expectations to make room for a deeper truth that needs no fascinating divisions to keep each other entertained. Opening to unpredictable strings so the truth of self meets the world - a clear naked reflection. ,"The self meets the earth through the other, and wonders through them what we are. Yearning to expose all the angles of our expression with the craving of full acceptance. Karma contains tremendous achievement and failure, and we spend much time living in the drama of either situation, rarely glimpsing the full spectrum of his own being. Attempting perfect execution, yet unconsciously guided to see between all definitions towards an open density, once we have let go of the need to be appropriate. ","Meeting the world to set a blaze on the other, expanding on their capacity. Often met with the disappointment that the other does not fulfill this same ability in us, as we do in them. Many relationships perception are built on how these experiences have affected him and can create a dissociative shell. When we recognize others will never be able to see the same possibly as us we can begin to devote ourselves more of the moment and becoming a vessel for mixing ingredients to create something new. We are merging our vision with the earth and in doing so those close to us may grow further away but closer to the whole. Merging consciousness with earth","He is open to a world of possibilities at every juncture to keep him plenty busy and engaged with his world. He is learning how to serve this energetic spontaneity, by stepping outside of himself and opening the doors to his beautiful primal expression. To meet the world and discover it endlessly as he desires, he must see he is the earth, not a self on the earth. In this way he does not see himself as something that is served by the earth, but rather an embodiment of it, that allows the primal energy to express itself openly and receive openly. ","She is in direct and in immediate contact with her world -  working to remove all barriers towards what is desirable and what is not. She is coming to know each relationship as its own unique universe which moves through all sides of life. At first she will love through each relationship as if it were her destiny, then she will move backwards and becoming internal and then she will enter into relationships with less expectations. Met by such karmic pulls that will be hard to find a solid foundation. Each relationship has much to work on and work through, she is learning to flow with the waves.","He meets the moment freely and freshly, capable of drawing out the potential within himself through direct contact with others. He often gets caught in surface reflections and an aversion to commitment, realizing that being ""free-minded"" can leave him empty and alone. He learns that true embodiment of self comes not from endless freedom, but from surrendering to the depth found in committed relationships.","
Earth: We are deeply in flow with our own rhythm and tune, but are one with the times and move along with life unstimulated by its walls. Life is a dream, and we are lazy in response, sulking timelessly inside what we have always known. 
Sun: We see the earth as ourself and are intrigued by the encounter. Our path is open to all is able to continually stretch, as we meet the other as ourself, and ourself as the other. We are coming out of our shell and into open willing candid contact with our world. Able to venture out and make free connections opening the doors for worlds yet to be.

She goes deep and catapulted into the sea of karmic unfoldment, "
8,"Moving and living deeply and closely in the heart of the world, in a state deeply unconditioned by this place. The challenge will be to stick as close as possible to this path and learn that all that is taught by this world is designed to take this  flow away. Coming up against the stream again and again.

Without an outlet one can become externally fixated and compulsive.," Knowing there is a part of our self that is not fully tapped and seeking to break through limitations to reunite us with the deep earth.

Ensuring to make the most of each moment by tuning into the whole spectrum of human experience and drawing out unseen worlds. Seeking the next dimensional relationship between self and world.

Space away from external stimuli allows forces behind the scenes to renew and spark a lifestream that doesn't over extend itself, but stays deeply inwardly in-tune with life's infinite unfolding beauty.

Even without engaging our potential we remain in a spectacular reality within the confines of a normal existence, having deep appreciation for it all. How ever far we are willing to take our experience will match our awareness, for as deep as it goes and much is mutually fertilized.

He seeks so vividly to pull out and make the most of each scenario, it takes some tuning before this energy learns to grow with the situation, rather than attempt to birth it fully. His energy carries a depth that he puts value in, and in turn others do as well, he must step aside the mirror of what they see in him, and can access a stream that is no longer clung to self and can become one with human nature and the surging power of its being. This can open up the same limitless power in others. ","She is open to the spectrum of experiences and feelings in each moment. She is open to receiving the love of the moment, however she cannot always receive the depths of the experience fully, because the world prevents us from going that far. However, since going far is how we know ourselves, we only find fragments and feelings of what it could be. An incredibly fertile ground that is plunged upon when one can go against all the intellect that holds one back from following the track of passionate intensity all the way.

He mistakenly searches for these secrets in the exterior world through over-intentionality, ignoring the inner call that warns ""don't go there."" He must stop striving and realize that the deep inner sea of infinity is already within him, allowing the gods to do their work.","Earth: We are deeply familiar with the systematic way of thinking, always forming themes and steps unconsciously ruminating in the linear connective tissue towards grasping a  deeper and deeper sense of the programing. None of this surfaces. 
Sun: the self is set to strip away all notions and assumptions, diving deep into each scenario with respect for the unknown. It will not hang out in the safe spaces and knows the only direction is fuller embodiment. We are here to experience the extreme truths, ",She is a magnet to lifes greatest lessons. She draws forth the moment with such depths that it unfolds in an intricate and transmutable stream that results in a myriad of seemingly impossible directions and insane outcomes. The vibration is infinity and she can get so caught in this stream that she is taken far out into the path of destruction. Life will always present itself with lessons through the lens of a horizon that has no ends. 
9,"We can see what is possible and must learn to take meeting this goal seriously. The goal is to break out of our one barriers, that way we cannot look down or back . We are captivated by the total view, taking the most direct, radically free step of self overcoming that breaks the final barrier of self needed.

We fall for it, grow through it, and uncovered it until the veil is thin and our awareness pierces through the experience of form. We are impressed with our journey, however the final stage is getting rid of our self importance and magnificent vision, so a virgin vantage point free of attachment can arise. ","Understanding we have a density and are awakening to a great truth. The language of spirit is internally formed. Our karma has come to an internal reckoning of life from all angles, good evil, truth and false hood, and is here to know ourself fully as we is. Any amount of blind distortion from the lesser self is amplified to form a great lesson. The self meets itself at trial, where we must pull past layers of scepticism and worthlessness, towards the the awakening of our great internal truth.","At the forefront of our awareness is the path to align with a higher initiative. Sensing we are being shown the way, and eager to be an active participate in our unfolding pattern. A lucky star to follow and be a vessel for great truth, or becoming defined by conventional success.  There is  a choice between achieving reputation and status or aligning with earthly forces to work for something bigger than ourself. Moving beyond the ego and any engrained mannerisms, to embody an inward vision as the light for all. Must come to reckon with the delusions of success and the ways that it severs reception from spirit. Following the inward light in manifesting good for all involved and becoming a living example of someone who followed the heart's centre because of the strength of its pull.","On a quest of coming to selfhood. Geared towards greeat self awarness and able to fine tune personal expression to the best, and return back on track. Continously up against our own personal desires and raw internal will, yet we do not address our shawdow until we have played up on all our good sides. Not able to see the total view as our inner will obstructs the full picture. Captivated by our capabilities, its only until we let go of our need to become somebody do we find total freedom ","The dissolving of the ego, the point in the process where the self can go and be anywhere with anything, but each dimension deeper will peel away and unveil any grasp on the self or ego. The dimensions being experienced tends to cancel out and contradict all hiding places and definitions of self. She goes as far as she gives herself permission, revealing the full spectrum of her being, and then attempts to integrate it to an extent in the physical world. Her reaction is to follow her internal truth, and when she does so much is compromised towards the highest mountains, when internal truth arrives.","His consciousness penetrates directly into truth, allowing his higher self to see the bigger picture past all false appearances. His lower self constantly finds ways to avoid this path, struggling against a calling that feels unfamiliar to the rest of the world. He is tasked with grasping this inner knowing and embracing a path that is not to be messed with, regardless of external validation.","Earth: We have been pulled in all directions and falled for all the temptations and pulls, without boundaries into the territory of anything goes. He has lost himself in the randomness of it all directions are burning out fast. 
Sun: We are being shown who we really are and sharpening our vision from all that we thought we were. Previous sporadically pulled actions reveal to have very little going or them. We become an advent in the process of awakening, the more it proceeds. We are seeking full embodiment, purging the self of all self serving delusions towards becoming a beacon of truth. ","She4 carries with her an inner knowing a statue, an elevated perspective that means she ill never be fully taken or bogged down by the moment. Everything carries an elevated frequency that sends he learning lessons with each moment, but never fully loosing herself to the depths of being human. Always staying just above the water, the full redemptive power of humanness is not explored, and the self is never truly lost, but peace of high consciousness remains. "
10,"Determining deepest needs of the community and then seeking to fulfill them. Many concerns can often saturate the self. The ultimate goal is to lead other to what they truly need through their own ability to embody archetypes that have yet to be defined. We are leaders, and thirsty for the next stage in human evolution that unifies heaven and earth. ","The demand for the self to show up reaches every angle and meets our central focus in each scenario. An urgency and responsibility as the spokesmen to lead by example. This task is hard to ignore and live up to so we're over shadowed by the feeling of having let others down. We are dedicating ourselves and sharping our inner knowing to carve a path that is cleared of the buzz and does not evade our scared awareness. We know what we need, and follow the steps from there towards our creative potential for concentrated and dispassion service. ","Holding firm the vision of what we must do, and hiding it under until it's prepared. Laying the foundation takes us on a journey with many unexpected turns that sheds our self justifying nature so we can discover whats truly needed for humanity. Staying grounded while we face the immense barriers that test our truth, teaching us to tune inwards towards a way of seeing that is independent of any events. ","Beyond the known, living in the streams of a truth yet to be. Aligned with the bigger picture of the collective need. A pure vessel for greater truths to come through. Flipped inside out and not held down by fact or personal limitation. Personal karma has been suspended to make room for the greater truth and we are learning to put ourself aside, or else we feel the burden of unworthiness. Gathering internal strength to become a vessel to meet the time with what is really needed for all.","A wide grasp on the whole with a distilled grasp on the problem so all can comprehend. The sights are on the truth of the wide scoop of the matter. We are the conduit to transmit the information needed to support the cause, and can strip it down to a systematic way of explaining it. Bring forth the gifts of others is our gift and out motive to transmit this universal grasp to help increase their perspective.  The complete giving over of consciousness to the greater cause and having the opportunity to channel universal applications is most fulfilling.

Universal understanding is diluted for the whole to consciously grasp.","Becoming a vessel for the common good. He gives everything to make it possible and on the jounrey discovers all the ways the shared conditioned world stops us from bringing through what is intended. Learning to distinguish between the shared collective view, and personal desire. We come up against the ceiling and must move through all personal doubt. We can hang out in the collective assumptions and roles for quite a time, but a future hints that its time to discover what else is possible. ","She is giving her knowing away, and is here to present to her truth with inspiration for the collective to unite upon. She had a generalized impersonal grasp and knows little of her inner soul, but does know her position on each issue, and has a grasp on its direction, impact and context. She has a loving openness to anyone apart of the current and change, and can open all doors of limitation. The gift arrives.  ","He is a stream bursting with timeless intelligence, offering up lifetimes of stored knowledge and wisdom to the world. He suffers from an extreme need to place himself outside himself, seeking to be seen rather than trusting his uncalculated inner knowing. To maintain his wisdom, he must discover an inner stream of self-acknowledgment rather than relying on external presentation.","Earth: We are submerged in all we are not, with a destiny held far from reach. There is a loss of hope, and even if it lies under the surface awareness it seems to undercut our life force, strung in the unknown. 
Sun: The way is bright, shift has turned to all that is and the spirit guides a bright way forward. The past is grasped as spent karma that has now been washed away with a fresh slate presented for the self to know and be all she is. We hold our experience with a wakeful watch.","She becomes a vessel for the truth of the earth, and tends to pass by anything that gets in this way. She is there to move in the way its meant to be down as if it was life's only mission. He ability to lead is tremendous and she obviously and subtly ingrained in her manner. This takes time to know with what direction it needs to move, but once tapped into it is virtually unstoppable. "
11,"Embodying the permission to be anyone and anything and be accepted be the group, can be their own dream or representation of the collective dream. Can represent the group, or lead in opening a whole new stream that is guided by timelessness and the unknown. Divergent destiny, pulled our of the consciousness stream. ","We are open to possibly, seeing it all, and perceived as the once who is able to take it all the way. Given a free pass to explore and stretch into worlds and beyond. If we cannot fathom the path of our own vision we will devote ourself towards an already formed greater stream of allegiance. Total power to be the representative of the group and the spokes personal for individual initiative. Being the one to go all the way with what they believe. ","Navigating beyond memory towards a sphere without any walls and into a completely liberated conscious way of seeing. Faced with a lack of foundation and many hurdles attempting to remove barriers to reveal the freedom we feel to be true. Aligning the body towards a greater purpose, opens a pathway towards a conversation with divine intelligence and a witness consciousness that can grasp great depths.","An open door moving onward and with a perception stretching to infinity. Open to messages from beyond and hard experience to communicate. We are often diluted to the one who advocates for what's more than meets the eye. A karma highly involved in the collective experience is now emerging with an awareness beyond time. The journey towards uniting all sides of consciousness to grasp the ultimate destiny, and moving them towards the horizon without doubt.","Aware before it happens and learning to believe in and venture out to the places that have not been seen. Cultivating faith and patience, while holding steady for these changes find rhythm and dance. A foot in the mud of a rushing river while the water waits to settle. In tune and aware of the significance of our mission, and able to play out other roles in the surface meantime. Trying on roles becomes a dance to experiment with the vibrations of collective currency. Our disguises are well hidden and provide freedom of movement from a deep place inside where the self has a grasp on the true vastness that a vision requires to ignite change on this earth.  ","Moving into open spoace. Discovering and facinated with the great wave of potential that moves us through time. An urge toward significant evolutinary changes and taking up the challenge of whats just becoming possible.

It can be taken one step further if given the opportunity for complete devotion of heart and soul to take the realistic steps forth in a project and guide the group forward.

She is always available for the next stage in the process, may sometimes loose those close in exchange or a greater world view. ","His vision leads the way forward with great leaps, possessed of deep awareness and a vast perspective on the future. In his eagerness to leap forward, he often forgets the necessary constructive steps and fails to recognize the truth of where he currently stands. He must learn to appreciate the process, understanding that his vision will be made clear only by attending to each step of the way.","Earth: We have fashioned ourself into a human of perfect embodiment of the standard. Our appearance and this outlet has given us focus, but the direction has turned sour. 
Sun: We abolish the personal ego to become more than we ever could have been. We are unitying with trust in totality. We can give our well cultivated gifts freely forward to lead others into the brotherhood. There are no streams that inhibit a full flow of loving intention. ","
She is open to infinite worlds beyond, but it takes courage to move against the grain and into the depths of infinity. She will be open to as many streams as she is brave enough to discover for she will try on all the coats of identity and conditioning  in the name of the moment, trying on every event for size hoping to escape the density which pulls her closer with every seemingly wrong turn away from it. Its is the extended journey taken against all odds to become the living example of the vastness our experience goes. Sometimes so far agist the social norm that it becomes resistance that fuels it "
12,"We are a processing system for the deepest most extreme enactment of human nature. No boundaries, and far can imagine the sensitivity of this position. A gateway to transform and transmute all that is false. The subtle notes of all horrors and wonders in full participation when we can conceive the inconceivable. "," We live in the unknown, the surface dramas do not penetrate us, and we focus among bringing to light the darkness. The depth we are grounded inwardly, matches the amount we can bring forward into the world. There is a fine line and volatile territory riding close to madness, distortions, and seeking to disturb all surface structure. Stirring up the undercurrent can often lead to further distortions. Learning to grasp this sensitivity comes from an inward resolve that can present the missing piece of the puzzle, found by the one who searched within the murky water.",Underneath our human ignorance lies a barrier of fear which few are granted permission to permeate. Transcending the illusion of safety to being the one who holds the crystalline awareness to see what is needed to move forwards. Sometimes discouraged by being the only one who feels the gravity of the situation and how to alchemize it. When we swims with our depths we are given permission and acknowledgment of the resources stored in the regenerative power of all lost hope.,"Profoundly introspective, helping the collective move inwards. Able to navigate lifetimes of memories and future visions without preference or attachment. Timelessly dreaming. There are no boundaries of time and we feel disconnected from the pace of society, being deeply aware of its nothingness. Standing apart from self we dwells in the space of whats driving nature and karmic forces. Forming in our soul what is not yet known on earth. A place of inward travel, with the need for external manifestation.","Inside the world and diving deep into every experience. Worlds that don't make sense seek to be comprehended here. Brewing a space to witness the truths that are hard to grasp, doing it unconsciously. Must pull behind the fears, and will come out with a greater lesson each time. In the process of weaving dreams and imagination through these deep inward places we find each time we are brought a fresh canvas or new departure point. When we can strengthen our draw towards these departure points over the darkness we become a wealth spring of fresh perspectives for all to nourish from.","He is going to the depths to tackle the impossible, becoming fearless. A tremendous power to move through hurdles with more power, where others would have strayed far. The energy forces the being to see through the assumptions, the collective denial, and digging for truth as he is energized by this destructive creative rebirth. Held back, to be pushed forward, each step deeper, no final reasoning, or logical reason to settling for less than being fully available to the greatest depths of the process which call us to take the punch and come back again. ","She is so closely knit to her world, she seeks to uncover the mystery brewing under each scenario that draws her in. This sort of passion takes one to the edge of any scenario and leaves her living on the edge of deep connection of utter rejection. She is learning to see in between these streams of duality into an ocean of shared participation with the deepest oceans of human connection.  ","He has the capacity to break the barrier with the collective, living within the undercurrent where he merges with infinity and shapeshifting energy. He strives excessively because he fears that slowing down will cause him to disappear into oblivion, yet this striving is doomed to fail. He must accept that his deepest fears of dissolution will come true, for in that surrender, he understands his strangeness and finds his true form.","Earth: We have become so attuned to the self and its performance we have followed a track of the structured business mind very far. The self is taken very literally and defined by fixed results, feeling as though we ourselves are a piece of data. 
Sun: We penetrate deep into the heart of our being and our awareness is opening into the unknown. We are a guiding home force and directed with passion. Many possibilities open towards leading one home that can be supportive of retrieving the gifts from inside others, or a stream of sacrificial devotion to an unknown current, with sacrificial pulls of totality. ","She dives deep to find the beauty in the pain, the deepest form of alchemy the soul needs to survive. If trapped in darkness it is suffering that becomes her comfort, it is the deepest form of truth wanting to surface, and it must be humbled in order to breathe. If not suffocated by sadness, may it be redeemed to discover it is the most pure form of love capable of burning through the ages that was waiting to surface. "
