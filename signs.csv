Aries,"A world centred around personal life presents the possibility for new potential. To grasp that the human experience encompasses many dimensions and possibilities had not yet been played upon. Intense drive towards forward motion and future currents. Seeing open possibility in a hard headed world, when everything is alive on the surface.","A serge to discover emerges and the sense that the old structures are becoming powerless pushes a break through to a new living future. A need to reform and advocate for change, passionately streams through as a beacon of destiny. Each one on their own journey, trampling over each other in the process.",We are stung with an entirely new impulse to take action as the divide between the world becomes too hot to handle. Overtaken by an impulse to get on with future and weaving into everyday. Working to take our passion from its wild frenzy into a focus that can reorient itself to a new life force.," A striking force becoming vibrantly present with a piercing desire to move anything that gets in the way of the truth unfolding. Sharp attention to what is meant to move, and whatever is causing a disturbance will be removed uncompromisingly. We are reckoning with defeat from karmic experiences that have devastated a spirit. We are powered beyond our pity with an intense focus on the present. This is the journey where the mental focus is tested, tried and strengthened to move past any doubts of a past swamped in depths."," Quick sharp discovery response to surroundings, attempting to divide the world into right and wrong. A dualistic perspective, charged and determined to come out on top being right. The internal drama is hot, and he plays out his reason why hard. As much as he reveals as the good guy, will be as much as is obstructed to reveal a contradicting perspective. Learning not to let the dialect consume him to leave space to see in between the lines.","Aware of our concerns and directing them forward to widen the space. Learning to integrate the concerns of the world with the concerns of self. When tuned in he can use this energy to widen the social sphere for everyone, but when he feels like his ideas are not respected by the world, he turns to dominance and aggression. Here it is clear he is his own worst enemy, and is learning to respect his own ideas. He doesn't need approval to be himself, but he does need to approve himself, to be approved by others. ","We sees ourself in the world and seek to discover who we are though the other. Constantly discovering the feeling the other creates in our own heart. The playground of relationships continues to expand as long as the other can stand its ground and give her the space to dance around, if the other is just recitable as she, she will recognize her loneliness. That she is seeking a piece of herself in the other. She will join into a relationship with herself, to discover the missing piece she was seeking in the other. ","learning to lean on the other for consciousness. Instead of relying so heavily on my own conscious action. 
He comes into interaction with the world in full force, becoming an active engager with every side to test of the limits of what he can get away with. What he misses in these endeavors is the subtle current of interaction that comes from deep subtle listening.His initial instinct is to remain the boss and under his own conscious control however life teaches connection comes from giving into the vulnerabilities of others. ","Earth:
 Drowning in the collective undercurrent and feeling like there is no room for any new individual. This energy is hard to take, and it means we meet our connections with an undercurrent infused with anger and a drive to remove all closeness.
Sun:
 We are infused with a spark and a direction forward that blows away all clusters of everything that the I cannot meet. The gates are open for a new consciousness to flow through. To take this star all the way is to set this fresh pace and allow others to be fully and unapologetically themselves.","Consciousness surfaces in its innate primal expression. Experimentation with instincts proves the wants and needs run down opposite streams. She runs upstream, creates friction through the lens of inadequacy to build her stronger. The strength of this consciousness goes as far as it can, tests the waters of her reactions, and lets them continue to lead her into trouble—until the denial of her small mind wears thin enough to lift a weight."
Taurus,"the earth comes alive inside the human being and we cannot explain the vastness we are tapping. Technology advancements heighten the importance of remaining natural and returning to the earth. Drawn into territory where we may feel alone, yet in the hands of angels. Those who have tapped this earth sensibility lay their eggs under the surface for growth down the line.","Earth begins to surrender to the forces of human will. Amplified growth in industry ignites new found external potential. Underneath a magical time of rebirth is occurring where we begin to see the earth a living light, alive with forces beyond what had ever been possibly imagined.",The earth is alive with new design and potential visions for the future. We participate with the electric state and impulse for the future. The vision of a new earth is an obvious and inevitable outcome and no one can deny it is being birthed a new way of being.,"An earthly energy that once has transformed itself, transforms the world around it. Standing in the midst and watching our world become us. Moving with grace from a guidance that views the self as home. The world outside is more complex than our inward situation and we find sanctuary from the contemporary matrix. Within our world we make thorough use of the resources at hand. Coming from a line of karma that has formed a strong pattern and is here taking it one step further. It cannot be expected to change, as we only know how to be true to the self we have always been. ","Consciousness is in an intimate creative conversation with the senses. A vessel to comprehend life's natural processes which speak to him quietly. Deep earthly awareness moving through itself, yet estranged by conflict of what is out of his sphere. Works to remove himself from confusion and external drama by staying creativity engaged with his own spear of sensibility.","Personal will at its strongest, remains on steady course and in touch with course at hand. Low focused ground earthy physical awareness that is not distracted by the outer world. A channel towards a greater path of embodiment, however when strayed from his truth, he becomes stuck on blind truths that have no grounding in reality. ","She is the way she senses the earth and participates in her senses. Unconsciously she is shutting out much of what complicates this reality and consciously forming a base around what she values, has created and worked for. Deep embodied appreciation for the process, and removed from many airy concerns. She is a rock for others and in silence brews depth and substance, The self is what is valued, and is a magnet for value. "," Learns what consciousness needs attending to and what is outside of the sphere. 
His attention steps in the area of life he finds most valuable, and romanates when conversation has moved on. He is a static processing system, consciousness generating what needs to be brought forward. The processing system cannot keep up with the constant stream of information and therefore must generate a subprocessing system that keeps up with the flow, and processes what information actually needs to land in the main processing system. ","Earth:
 A burial ground for memories that senses our world to be destructive and dangerous. We hold back from the unknown and fear our internal worlds as strange and unfamiliar, petrified rock.
Sun:
 We discover there are ample resources everywhere for the fertile soil of love. Self-awareness is an unlimited field that endows a spirit with the desire to grow and build new life. Cultivating stability to enjoy the spontaneity and celebration of existence. Everywhere there is deep meaning, and an innate perseverance and rhythm to its discovery.","She slides into a dream that is the familiar. Everything surrounding her she has always known, and she wears it comfortably, participating in the pattern. She casts a magical shell of senses, guarding her world fully and uninterruptedly. To change would require breaking the spell that protects her against everything out of the sphere of this zone. Moving from it drags onward, longingly in a trail of slowly integrated growth—but beyond opens up worlds of the unknown."
Gemini,"Earth comes vibrantly alive with new streams of beginnings and endings. A wave with the motion to move forward without looking back and an excitement to enter the dimension of our multidimensionality becomes appealing. No longer be held to the structures that kept the systems glued for centuries and the vision for the power of the individual, lives on.","The world is alive with so many streams of cross current fertilization on multiple dimensions, all evolving with little known end in sight. Mental world and ideas are highly celebrated with an acceptance to innovation, but lack of commitment to any one stream. Energy begins practising the embodiment of a full dimensional being.","We are persuaded into so many directions and suffer from instability. So many streams of expression and new developments arrive, often leading to destruction, and lack of foundation. Those who do not get swamped in this energy, can use it to recreate what is necessary and live their dreams in full appreciate of the process. ","Two sides on drastically different versions of self. One side vastly open to the world and all possibilities, this edge keeping us curious and fascinated with an infinite stream of insights that existence keeps sparking. The other is a more grounded and subtle that is aware of all the small obstacles and systems of control that prevent our expansion. It is a world driven by openness and contraction from a karmic condition has dealt with feeling an of obstruction of life force from lives where we've expanded have been unable to live up to our full potential. Integrating an internal strife and tendency for extremism, through meeting extremes we seeing a greater context that weaves the path towards a wider horizon."," Ideas and conscious experience cast a large net lite up to encompass a multi dimensional universe. Glowing in response to possibly, open to perceiving the multiple ways of seeing. Learning to keep a fluent open grasp to digest all sides. Imagination is key to staying present here or else becoming trapped in a chaotic catastrophe of desires and self imposed boundaries from an over-stimulated mentality, without a focused path. ","He is in discovery of his truth and his world is a wide net with the ability to stretch in all directions. Embracing possibility at each junction. Oftentimes the world cannot feed  him the energy required, so he creates fantasies or tangents of reflections to keep it alive. Everything is either a dream or reality, he is all of it or none of it. Requiring embodiment of the vision. ","She is in a relationship with infinity and sees infinite capabilities with no boundaries - this sense lies out in front of her as she flys freely towards. The search is a total view point to expand limitlessly. This takes time to embody fully and she is learning to grant herself permission by taking small steps through the embodiment of these many enthusiastic sides. She meets all spectrums of experiences because she is open to them. Her sympathy is universal but her self awareness is lacking. She is unattached as she is moving beyond herself, and is unaware of how far out she has traveled. Stretching the hearts center out into the earth. ",Taps into the larger current of communication and plugs in mentally. Becomes a mirror and a magnet for radiating the voice of high consciousness for the group. Takes communication from the level of the personal and amplifies it to the collective. Has the ability to use the consciousness of others to tap into a reflection of self that disguises even himself . ,"Earth:
 We are convinced that the world around us is designed to block us from our expression, and we meet only fragments and fractions of self in the world. This consciousness lies in fantasy, and when it does meet what it wants in the real world, it does with such enthusiasm that it slams down its opponent in the process.
Sun:
 The self is lit up to regrasp all versions and slides of self, seizing the outlet for all versions of expression it had formed. It is entering into the infinite through weaving the worlds in between and mirroring this to others. With new worlds of self to conceive, she is a merging of the twins, the following of the conversation, where each side opens and all sides of perceptive intellect expand.","She rides the waves, weaving together potential with existence. Known and unknown stitch the discovery of each step. Sliding along the surface, living in lightness, floating, gathering, assessing, and bridging worlds of potential to thread them into reality. The pace is set to infinity; the race eventually comes to a place where she learns there is just as much to discover internally as there was on the outside."
Cancer,World order is shattered wand darkness reigns. The problems and karma from the past surface and this generation is left to alchemize them. Lack of hope stacks up against infinite unknown.Very few can pierce through this time to become masters at weaving back lost souls to spirit connection., Earth begins eroding the social structures and cast systems. A desire to go against the larger systems makes itself known. We witness the final grasping of security as the world we knew came to an end.,New design for a way of life emerging through the home life. We central our values and remain safe in the midst of chaos. Rural farm life becomes suburbs and the growth of the individual goes up against tight limitations and social requirements. Surviving multiple ego deaths equips us with a cantering force to sustain future life currents coming through.,"Learning how to integrate into every situation of life and becoming supremely adept at handling our self within the context of everyone else. Carving space for full embodiment of others, but in doing so we blur the difference between our own responsibility and the problems that arise, in turn becoming a vessel for all that is wrong. When the karmic journey has become one with the known and is closely bound in it experience, a space in-between opens to reveal when we step away from taking on collective responsibly personally - we can use our large perspective in each situation without getting wrapped up in it."," In touch with the heart of the matter. Piercing through the many sides towards a perspective beyond impressions. Seeing through to the bigger picture and common goal to become a focused point of wisdom and channel for the truth to emerge. Can not be expected to stray into opinions of multiple sides and instead remains a steady beacon of focus in a scattered world. Where truth intelligence meets the body, and the gravity of the heart meets the reality of the situation."," He is fine tuning his energy expression to give what is most needed, no more or less. He understands his world from many angles and takes action based on where his heart is at. Can sense into the future and how he will be perceived so he is conserving energy for its optimal use. Gifted to tune into the complex matrix of existence and determine what is needed. If trapped in everybody's else's needs he becomes immobilized. ","There’s deep contact with collective longing, and the work lies in integrating that vastness into personal, tangible life. Inner yearning becomes the source of creative strength, but external engagement may be delayed until a safe internal space is cultivated. From that place, collective memory is channeled through the heart, becoming a vessel of transmission. This is the path of embodying ancestral knowledge, carrying emotional messages the world may not yet know it needs.","Perspective is far reaching, yearning for the optimal outcome, and he is attempting to weave this perception into how he must behave in the present. Often riddled with providing the optical solution for what is given, having a deep understanding of how he believes it ought to be, yet his participation as this being is an ongoing question. Integrating collective consciousness, in a transition from being the one who sees it all, to being one of many. Grasping and fashioning my own view from a collective perspective. "," Earth:
 We are glued to our purpose. Fed into a role of carrying the biggest burden that has been planned for ages, with a rearranged fate made to make the best of all scenarios. The best being drawing gratification from glorifying its own virtue, and self-restraint. Belief in ability perpetuated by belief in ability is seeking earthly success as a form of self-avoidance.
Sun :
 The self is in direct, unavoidable impact with a fresh life stream, awakening the sides that worked for others, now work for self-cultivation. We are in a new world now, not the one we were once trapped in, and our own world from deeply within reveals its own strides. When we come to recognize a memory that we were always ourself, and have been merging our rhythmic process this whole time. Made to merge others with their own internal values."," She molds herself into a vessel for the common good through maintaining a protective layer for the secret she holds inside. The secret is a lens that holds the world as a collective. Everything is assimilated through the understanding of the whole. She nurtures the micro, and the macro shapes the reality of her perspective. As the collective is imposed onto the experience, she misses the earthly, involved experience of being human. She denies this through participating in the greater story, which eventually develops into a truth far vaster than any collective assumption could grasp."
Leo," 1938-1957: Weaving together heaven and earth with a heightened sensibility of self, due to the friction of the existing contemporary context. The core of the individual is set a flame with convictions and righteous from the fragments of a destroyed world order . It takes remarkable strength to take the flame to its full potential.",the value of each individual surfaces and we begin to abolish the structures that deny our human experience. Championing the bold and creative imagination. Surface identities have plenty of fun hyping up the external personality and we begin seeing the self through a caricature lens.,"life is flourishing with the free expression of the individual as the driving force. Celebrity culture begins to flourish and cartoons become a dominate creative expression. Those able to get over the identity facade and endure the ego blow, can emerge free from discouragement and be an embodiment of freedom for all."," A strong and noble force of life purpose. Our path is to respect and follow individuality which never leaves our sight as we meet ourself again and again sticking to the intentions set. Continually seeking to discover this commitment in others and is not met with the same dedication. One with our truth, but must learn to leave the space for others who are less self assured. The karma at work has done all the steps towards fulfilling individuality, and is ready to give over our self importance. Once we have found our place we can step through the veil of individuality into being one with the heart of the world. ","Personal truth meets itself in the world. Sensing the selfs way of seeing as central and pivotal, and exercising its purpose with each stride. Gifting the world with a well presented and graciously curated enlarging and empowering viewpoint that is able to take up each stage of becoming with fully embodied strength. The energy comes from the heart and maintains a strong foundational truth and central pillar of reference for coming to self hood for all.
","He is on a path of self embodiment that people make way for and no one can deny. He can bring forward his gifts to inspire, regenerate and strengthen the collective. He is closely guided, right mode, breeding right action. If he betrays the hearts cause at  the will of his own programming and self worship, the downfall will be self destructive, leaving him blindly achieving destiny alone. ","Emerging from unity with all, the path now leads inward to individuality. At first, identification stretches outward—being one with everyone, mirroring back their light. But as the journey continues, attention turns inward, toward an inner flame. There’s a realization that all the mirrored roles were merely practice—reflections leading back to the core self. The true light is reclaimed, not through performance, but through integration of every unconventional part. ","What he finds in himself, he meets in the world. His Internal structure is in tune with the beat and is pulled towards the world as a playground for self development. If he should follow a quest of inner knowing, it will be unmistakably true. However if he should put himself in the shoes of many others, this density will be shocking. He is learning not to judge someone for not  being fully themselves, and jump to conclusions. Moving beyond the convenient explanation, initial impression to being fully aware of multiple perspectives.","Earth:
 We have grown old on this soil and merged with many individuals. We are inwardly aware of how to serve the group and have been preoccupied with merging with the collective. In the process, we have lost sight of who we are, and we can't understand how we've done it, since the intention was rooted in our intimately cultivated version of self. We know who we’re supposed to be, but the image needs to be dropped.
Sun:
 We shine a bright light on the part of self that always looked too good to be true. The side we hide in order to conform is now alive as its own identity. We at last can cherish who we really were and show up in celebration. Everything we express is a process of our own awakening to touch life with true and full heart-centered embodiment. We believe in our own creation.","The center of the heart bursts through as expression. She meets herself in the world and is dazzled by the act of dreaming herself into being. Delighted in herself with the personality she has become—however, the source of this energy requires deeper digging. As she grasps the vitality of this expression, curiosity grows about where the foundation of this stream stems from."
Virgo," 1957-1971: The world is taken over by rampant threats of technology, and this generation is pulled to witness and integrate many sides to become a matrix of conciseness. Ability to discern through the truth and false deception towards integrating multiple perspectives and tapping into a life stream that is un-scattered and freshly attuned.","An intricate sensibility weaving a foundation for a world that calls the human being to grow into its truth. The failing of structures and world order crushes personal initiative, and energy begins to work under the scenes to rework the systems from underneath. Tapping into an intelligence that cannot be intimidated or disturbed by swirling contradictions.","We get to work tending the seeds for a new future. Worlds within worlds that had no past currency began to prosper. Everyone is saturated with the feeling of needing to make it work and this motivates much of the generation to prove themselves. Enabling a discernment at each stage to know where we will go right, and where we can go wrong. Lovingly able to draw forth in others what is most vital.","Steady on task with the matter we've created in our sphere of life. Attempting to structure ourself around the subtle forces of the intent at hand by creating blinders from the rest of the world. Many hurdles on the path towards wholeness. We take all facets and experiences, digest them through our lens, and slowly begin opening the doors for the rest of the world through a process that is entirely character building. The goal is to finally take the leap, jumping into the moment of where it's at and meet life in a way to perpetuates the wave. Something that at first seemed impossible becomes easier with time, and finally allows the self formed path to become one with the process of where it's at. ","The point of the journey when personal truth becomes aware of its impact on the earth. Either on point and channelling what is needed or feeling at odds with multiple perspectives and a fragmented execution. Many sides and voices to consider, so one must loosen its pragmatic grip and engage with constructive steps forward or else becoming helplessly trapped in a sea of contradictions. Tapping the goodness of life to find a focused intelligence that provides an abundant path forward.","He is geared to balance and make whole life for everyone. This places him in the center of unfolding events with a physical participation of the most grounded approach, where everything is accounted for and nothing can go wrong. Energy moves as a series of tasks, and multitude of skills, applied with precision and when to a specific direction, reaches perfection. When off task he is overwhelmed by nagging voices and chaotic information. He is channelling these voices and many selves into a supremely fine tuned upbuilding force. ","Multiplicity is handled with strategy—life divided into what matters and what does not. Great care is given to maintaining a chosen sphere of focus, fine-tuning each step, keeping watch over what has long been deemed worthy. Each action is practical, rooted in deep sensibility. Yet true expression will only emerge when the emptiness beneath it all is acknowledged and embraced. What is built externally must be balanced with internal surrender."," His perspective is so open to the matter that he is able to perceive all perspectives at once. Everypoint contains an opposite perspective, it's as if a multitude of voices is attempting to make balance, based on an open consistent perspective. To interpret this multitude of voices he learns not to sway too far, by remaining partisan enough not to jump into one and exteriorize the other. When he can learn that the goal of each voice is to point out the missing parts then he can learn to see them more lightly, and cherish embodying a mind that can grasp all sides. Learning to integrate information rather than define it. ","Earth:
 The self is drowned in memories and waters of the collective unconscious that we have no ability to navigate or make sense of. There is such a permeable membrane to the sub-voices and fantasies that the self exerts a degree of unconscious consciousness to stay grounded. These worlds have no explanation and are thoroughly irrational.
 Virgo:
 The sun comes in with a sturdy wisdom and applicable intelligence about life's processes. We travel through a maze guided by the details to formulate solutions that structure all of life's nuances. We are seeking to out-distance our fears, in our chosen sphere, through an intellectual solution that splices through all irrational worlds. We are coming from uncertainty, into our fullest embodiment of truth and all its subselves, to a vessel that recognizes it is perfectly pulsing to the beat of the planets."," She is derived from many sides and selves, each speaking a various familiar language. She works on staying neutral to witness a myriad of perspectives. Slowly, a divine integration towards the core of her being arises. The awareness becomes tuned and poised. The sub-selves do not disappear; they keep the perspective honest and clear."
Libra," 1970's-1980's Many chapters unfolding revealing a new promise, with none of its permanence surfacing. A matrix of experiences and perspectives with the option to choose what is desired. Serving the image of the dream pushes us to learn how to ride waves on uncertainty.", A juxtaposition between the destruction of communities and the uniting of humanity under a greater current. The current of hope grows stronger as do the opposing forces. There becomes a heightening participation of the expression of individual truth and interest in the vastness of the human psyche.,"Wondrous life streams burst forward for the first time generating their own collective currency. A renaissance of freely and imaginative worlds, coming to life. A feeling permeates that none of this can last but its effects were timeless and inwardly planted. These individuals carry high idealism and stark realism. Those who can hold to this vision steady can carry the seed for generations to come."," Awareness at the core that the surface path is likely to be misleading, and coming out of a hazy grasp towards fully embodying our personal journey. Tempted and pulled towards the socially acceptable, seductively appropriate path, but being weighed heavy with feelings of self betrayal. Our journey is one of self recreation, with a full blooded determination to fill the shoes of our imagination. A karma that had once lost its self belief, is continually asked to make the harder choice and take higher road to find we are able to continually meet ourself as the earth at the edge of its evolution."," Mental analysis enraptures the individual, leading to the pulls of what's right and wrong. Feelings are racked with uncertainty but yield significant results when held with faith. Reactions must be freed of social standards and preconceived versions to sense into the present moment so innate inner truth can be heard. Learning to move freely with the waves of the scenario, into the cracks of the irrational and speak directly from what arrises in the moment. "," He is finely crafting his expression for maximum extraction of interactions. Can sense into the emotional atmosphere and is able to instinctively devise an expression that will weave the situation closer. He is available to meet each moment candidly, while carrying a plan and direction forward. This is where the world of the self has learned to optimize external resources to create an expansive dance of self embodiment drawing out expression from others. If instead used for controlling others, manipulation, he becomes a reverse image of what was meant and embodies his shadow. ","There is an openness to meet love in each moment without resistance. A spark of life lights every interaction, raising the beauty in each connection. But this magnetic presence can attract projection—becoming everyone’s ideal, rather than a whole self. The work lies in breaking the mirror, releasing the need to be adored, and participating in life not just as reflection, but as a complete being. Love is found when authenticity surpasses appearance.","he has the kind of mind designed to heighten every social situation and shared perspective, seeking to merge with the consciousness of the group. He delights in being a lighthouse of enthusiasm for others, and his mind can string together all forms of connections towards cross pollination. However he is deeply out of tune with his true inner world, and ultimate goal is to find out how he truly feels in the moment, or his contribution feels transparent. He sees life as too fun to be tied into the inner world, and it will be a series of drastic events that pull him towards this unknown world. ","Earth:
 We come in direct impact with the other and use them as a tool to sharpen the self. We are so turned on that the subtle touches don't make their way into our personality. We draw ourself so deep into the world, that we must draw ourself out by purging all the hopes and goals that stemmed from the identities we collected, to understand what dreams live on.
Sun :
 The self begins to explore its vibrancy and comes in contact with the truth of the earth in a way it never expected. We are making space for the other to emerge, and are deeply empowered by our impact and understood through the reverberation of the other. We are so many levels deep in our versions of who we might be that the journey reveals many forms. The end search is for who we really are amongst all the impact created. Turns out there are many ways to know the self, and the highest expression is a vessel for us to embrace our transformation without any judgment or imposed identity.","Her lens is a rainbow spectrum, with each experience holding its own color, shape, and form. She is entering the world as a maze and becomes lost in the various outward expressions of events. Only once the reflection has been fully explored and the insides emptied will the inner shadow speak louder."
Scorpio,1980-1990s New world begins to be revealed and the old world order begins to shed its final layers. Piercing drive and awareness cuts through to reveal how long the human soul has been frozen. Freedom comes up against the densest patterns and carries an intensity and urgency.,We take things to the extreme on all fronts. The world is filled with intensity and we seek to bring the light. A knowing surfaces that we need to throw off all false appearances. New depths and connection are revealed through turbulence. This truth is held in the darkness and the underbelly of a world in complete denial of its potency. , deep unseen forces and fears stop progression and leave a barren empty sense to the world. The discovery of new cosmic forces stimulates the awareness of higher forces and unseen potential. Individuals who are not consumed by the collective karma become adept in navigating darkness and emerge with the power of a mission that is unable to be destroyed.,"We are moving into the depths of every experience in order to break through a well of karma that has been living in a less than fully embodied state. We are learning to rise up, by moving through the lowest patterns, seeing them for their truth, and fiercely moving forward. We meet ourself in the flames of destruction. The persistence to transform is vital as each hurdle presents another. Anyone else would be tremendously hindered by this path, but it is what invigorates us. We are pleased to take up the path of self overcoming. ","Ego is shedding to awaken the power of an unknown voice. Planetary forces intervening to dissolve self contained worlds. Unable to waste time identifying with personal notions and fixed identities. Feeling swamped by delusions and external disguises, yet a truth beyond truth persists to take up an unpredictable journey that pierces through all falsehood into the core of ones being. Discovering a sea of infinity within the unknown behind being any one at all.   ","Passionately absorbed in everything, carries a lens of dispassion to prevent full absorption. He is in the process of accessing a full stream of liberation life force and can sense it around the corner. This drives him mad with the need to break through and the seemingly impossible ways to do so. A point in the journey where the stream for self liberation and excess of creative energies lives in breaking the boundaries at the core of the matter - which if not pushed through can feel as though existence is impenetrable and poisoned by denial. ","Life is the process moving through itself—one’s own vessel the only one capable of true transformation. Emotional logic overrides rationality; the deepest route is always chosen, even when it becomes destructive. At times, emotion is starved to reset. Energy is poured into total self-overcoming, driven by a raw and potent force. This is the one who dares to go all the way—not to survive, but to fully transmute.","He is subtly connecting the dots under the surface, and implying way more than one layer of experience or interpretation. His consciousness is connected to the current and he is tantalized by the way it expands when he can get out of his own. The desire to move the self out the way to get to optimal mental capacity is strong and therefore any disturbances on this journey, he believes to be above him. The purpose is to be humbled at each corner as we come with the reckoning that these tiny disruptions are actually, deep rooted problems. The pebbles were actually boulders, and ingenuousness cant move them. ","Earth :
 We feel entrenched and lost in a dark dream. Wallowing, deeply frozen in the physical forces of earth where we lose ourself and move into an egoless state. A core state which cannot be touched, a shell of yearning and memories lost and forgotten. Time served in the dungeon to forget who we are.
Sun:
 We awaken from death, born into new life. Recent rebirth creates an awe for life and leaves deep appreciation for the dark forces that brew a self encompassing all sides. An energy of universal depths with limitless streams of life forces from all directions, moving with great stride and free from all hindrances that once encompassed them.","She is seeking herself and will move through every depth and darkness to reveal her power to herself. She lets the shadow swallow her whole to move through destruction, recreation, regeneration, and to reweave the past, assimilating sheer courage. Once the karma has been shredded, she is left with a clear breath ahead, and the memory of the path she took to get here becomes all she knows."
Sagittarius ,End of the 20th century gives life to a creative intuition that renews earth and takes it all the way. A deep awareness of the direction needed to go and truth about what it gives and what it takes internally. A sharp eye comes forth to blend and reimagine where we are moving.  ,"The potential of a vibrant new earth begins to surface. Souls are hot on fire to grasp their own vital life force. Surface forces become further adapt at tuning human consciousness towards mechanization, and people must learn to distinguish between whats real and what is false deception. "," Destructive forces escalate and seek to take the individual trust and turn into a compulsive fear reaction. Feeling unsupported and alone we are left to each personally discover a new stream of trust inside. We sense there is new possibility and then gradually lay its foundation. Alchemizing the discouragement the generation faces by living on the edge of old worlds, and the cusp of new ones.","Taking all our scattered bits and pieces and molding them together into great structure and master plan. A wildness we are learning to tame, and in the friction of working against ourself we are driven forward towards remarkable leaps of embodiment. Our nature is volatile and persistent, and we are here to over come it. Letting ourself down just to build back up. This karma seeks to view life from an entirely different perspective, coming from feeling we have not met the standards, the search is for an entirely new angle and we are learning how to work with our fresh insights.","Budding with the new potential, yet subconsciously aware of all the forces that cause it to go wrong. The subconscious fears stay ready and grounded, and allow the consciousness to run wild and free with its biggest dreams. Once one can begin to reckon with the part that assumes that something is innately going to go wrong, by acknowledging that the first leap is never going to be initially supported as it is a vision a head of its time, they can open more freely to allow new potential to flow through.","A spirit of high self conviction and a genius multi dimensional fluidity.  Adept at navigating all the waves, curves, and currents with resilience, and will whip out whatever talent is needed to get him involved with what is unfolding. When he takes the image of himself as invincible, his imagination can draw him into the abyss about who he, a story that will be true, but will be one of blind self worship, captivated by his own self enchantment. This is the placement for getting the point across, and exploring it again and again, which can be a beautifully fulfilling lens to open to spontaneous experience, or if solidified can become a story needing to constantly reinforce about the way he wants to see himself. ","The potential of the moment pulses—energies seeking release, sides of the spectrum wanting embodiment. There is a natural generosity to allow what wants to emerge. But when energy fades, disappointment follows. The cycle of seeking continues until it is revealed that deeper fulfillment lies not in the next wave, but in sustained presence. When this perspective turns inward, the vibrancy of life is no longer momentary—it becomes lasting wisdom.","He is open to receiving each view without being partisan and can be trusted by the group to speak for everyone. He is aware of what goes and its value in social currency, however concepts of a subtler frequency, that do not carry the same initial value, reveal there is something going on deeper and under the scenes of his immediate surface impressions. He is learning to see things with passion and motivation, and grasping the heart of the matter. Going from the cool one to the one who cares. This means tuning into the arena of interaction, where we learn to gave surface impressions as little weight as possible, and leaning into the deeper current, by taking what calls to us seriously. Tuning into what truly motivates and what is worth pursuing with passion. ","Earth:
 We are losing ourself at play of our desires, moving in a scattered direction towards any place where we can be free and relieve the burden of carrying selfhood. We love to not really be there, and have a crew of stand-in characters to allow for the expression of self to remain straight on and on the surface.
 Sun:
 Entering into the world of play with a form of awareness that sets fire to each scenario, burning through it deeper to reveal the unfoldment of self.

To charge the earth with the same hold as the sun. We are grounding the desires and yearnings of the child to an inner knowingness that can take the world anywhere at play. The vast perspective that yields moment-to-moment awakening and discovery.","The door swings open, and around every corner, a mystery—guided by curiosity, fueled by surprises. Every moment a hunch, craving to be explored and embodied with the time it meets. Her position can be easily disheartened by the lack at which the rest of the world meets her enthusiasm. She builds a façade that keeps one side seemingly normal, while allowing the other track to run wild. Only when she has spread this track thin will a path reveal itself as her own true nature."

Sensing  through all the illusions at every corner and keeping intact a vision that is piercing through. Strong souls from major turning points in history come to uphold the truth for the creation of a new world..,"Life on earth becomes a multidimensional organism and many progressive streams open to address the visions and many rising concerns. Darkness attempts to hide our individual power by drowning us in mechanization, however this generation is trained to sift out the truth and use the problems at their food to flip the whole thing around. ","We know ourself and have a clear intention for the steps needed to take. The path to becoming will be met with bizarre events and experiences that deny what we knows inside to be true. This karma has gone to great heights and depths, and has a finely tuned awareness to mobilize tremendous forms of human attainment. Designed to stay grounded and in touch with our perspective while integrating contradicting experiences. We must reOtherwise swept into tireless tasks swamped by a dark and grim stark awareness.","The final flushing out of the egos control of the mind. Inner knowing is strong, and anything unknown strengthens this knowing to prove itself further. This frictional conversation, slowly gives way to a deeper understanding that looses the mind control, opening our highest potential for embodied truth. Learning to believe that we are here for the collective enables us to merge our self with the needs of the earth. Or else we risk becoming a vessel for power control and manipulation. ","The inward purpose being fine tuned for its immediate expression. Accommodating the inward perspective to gather awareness for its outward physical release.

","Every step is observed with precision—the self in constant refinement, aiming to express a truth with perfect execution. But outward striving often masks inner feelings of lack.

The truth lies not in one side, but in the dance between the two.","Consciousness that is prepared to deal with everything, because its awareness is sharp and clear. He is deep in his truth, and awareness is tuned to all motivating factors behind human condition. This means he grasps the truth behind our failings and is training perception to be able to hold space for the true nature of reality. Standing in this truth takes much tempering and self overcoming in a world that loves denial, for one to stand in full embodiment and see beauty when there are no leaves on the trees. ","Earth:
 We have a deep desire to externalize our being, and in doing so cannot find the soil to ground a path of deeper development. Hiding from the roles we cannot play by devoting to a group where everyone is fully devoted and she can lose herself in the group identity. We find places to merge our energy in the forms that allow the darkness to grow.
Sun:
 An energy that reveals to be is far more inwardly motivated and developed than previously physically experimented upon. All the energy needed for development that was previously missing. We discover that all we are meant to do was be, where all the energy had previously been taken up in the doing. The truth pulse of earth surfacing as an inner knowing: what I am. It may take a while to recognize that this path is truly ours, and that truth will not surface without doing the work to discover who you really are.","She is utterly willful in her desire to fulfill her path. Vigorous in her convictions and without an ability to settle for less, she holds such a standard that the ultimate lesson becomes learning to humble herself. Only through continuous brute force of ego-will power will the self meet itself as the cause, and the lesson emerges that each stage of the journey was perfect in its own right."

After mastering intelligence that serves the human ego, we have a desire to redo and realigned with nature. ",The visions becomes expressed for evolution that with long range potential. The counterforces are just as destructive turning each stream of potential into systematic programming that cleverly turns everyone against themselves and each other.

 Enraptured in the surface self, the truth of expression is hidden and lost in the thrills of admiration. Generating recognition from the exterior world through perfected external image.

Pisces ,"1800- 1823 Earth begins to sink into an understanding that provokes creation to highlight all thats been missing. Humanity fights for survival and earthly forces shed light on the dangers of a technological revolutionized society.

In deep contact with the subconscious forces and unconscious memories that make it hard to find a footing. Submerged in the flashes and finding comfort in the dreams, which carry an other worldly familiarity and see reality from an observe stance.
